Set up the main question

The following chapter, Chapter 2, will describe the eye-specific RGC axon organization in the developing optic tract. 
Chapter 3 explores the role of self-fasciculation differences between ipsi and contra RGC axons in tract organization. 
A novel {\it in vitro} method is discussed. 
Subsequently, in Chapter 4, the receptor tyrosine kinase EphB1 is examined for its role in fasciculation and establishing eye-specific RGC axon order in the tract.
Finally, the results presented will be summarized and synthesized to propose a new perspective on the organization of the developing optic tract and one of the possible mechanisms by which it is organized.
