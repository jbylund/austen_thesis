As discussed in the first section, RGC axons in the developing binocular visual system are orderly in the proximal optic nerve, unravel and undergo rearrangements near and within the midline choice point (the optic chiasm), and then regain order in the optic tract. 
Midline radial glia and a raft of early-born neurons caudal to the midline glial palisade provide guidance cues at the optic chiasm (reviewed in \cite{erskine2014connecting,petros2008retinal}) that direct the crossing of contralateral RGC axons \cite{charron2003morphogen,erskine2011vegf,kuwajima2012optic,williams2006role} and the repulsion of ipsilateral RGC axons \cite{williams2003ephrin,petros2010ephrin,petros2009specificity,}. 
Similarly, a transient neuronal population at the cortical midline called the subcallosal sling is important for guiding axons across the callosal midline during CC development \cite{suarez2014evolution}. 
Subcallosal sling neurons express Sema3C, which attracts Nrp1-expressing pioneer cingulate cortex neurons \cite{niquille2009transient,piper2009neuropilin}. 
These two guidance molecules have lately been found to play an important role in establishing the dorsal-ventral organization of callosal axons \cite{zhou2013axon}. 

In another midline system, the developing ventral spinal cord, a host of molecular mechanisms have been elucidated that guide axons to, through, and out of the floor plate, which contains radial neuroepithelial cells that function as glia (reviewed in \cite{neuhaus2015crossing}). 
Early work in the chick floorplate revealed that crossing the midline leads to a change in surface cell adhesion molecule (CAM) expression from TAG-1 to L1 on commissural and motor neuron axons \cite{dodd1988spatial}. 
This change in surface protein expression on axons and their growth cones could be a common mechanism guiding midline-crossing axons through and beyond the choice point into the continuation of their tracts. 
It is possible that such midline-induced changes in surface expression could lead to specific bundling and organizational behaviors of post-midline axons in their developing tracts. 
This has yet to be tested in the visual system, but a change in surface CAM expression on ipsilateral and/or contralateral RGC axons could affect interactions between the two axon cohorts or between one group of axons and the tract environment. 

In systems where axon tracts navigate across a midline choice point, it is challenging to disentangle the molecular mechanisms at the choice point from later organizational mechanisms at play within the tract or target. 
In other words, are post-decussation organizational events tract-specific or consequences of events occurring at the choice point (e.g., putative changes in CAM expression on axons)? 
This question is experimentally challenging, given the difficulty in isolating molecular events in the tract from those at the midline or at the target, especially in systems where the same guidance molecules are present at multiple steps in the pathway. 

Recent work in the auditory system has shed light on this issue by showing that aberrant navigation of the midline decussation point leads to subtle but critical functional defects of subsequent synaptic connections, apparently independently of target-derived cues \cite{michalski2013robo3}. 
Conditional knockout of Robo3 from contralaterally projecting ventral cochlear nucleus neurons causes their axons to misroute ipsilaterally. 
The misrouted axons innervate their appropriate target, the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body, but with incorrect laterality. 
While axon targeting appeared grossly normal, closer structural and physiological examination revealed failures in synaptic maturation. 
It is unlikely that Robo3 is directly involved in synaptic development in this case, as it is downregulated immediately after the axons decussate in wild-type (wt) mice. 
Further, temporally controlled conditional knockdown of Robo3 after decussation showed no effect on synaptic development \cite{michalski2013robo3}. 
The authors conclude that the act of decussation at the midline conditions the axons of ventral cochlear nucleus neurons for appropriate synaptic development. 
Hence, while this study does not examine axon order in the post-decussation tract, it underscores the idea that individual events along a pathway, such as interaction with the choice point or intermediate target, can have subtle and surprising effects on downstream steps in the developing circuit (e.g., targeting or, theoretically, tract order). 

Work in the thalamocortical system has demonstrated how a non-midline intermediate target region can influence axon order in a tract. 
As described earlier, TCAs are topographically ordered as they pass through the developing striatum and IC \cite{garel2014inputs}, where a population of migrating guidepost cells creates a permissive corridor for extending TCAs in an otherwise growth-prohibitive environment \cite{bielle2011emergent,lopez2006tangential}. 
Perturbing the development of the corridor region leads to disordered TCA topography in the corridor, causing a subset of TCAs to fail to reach the cortex \cite{garel2002early}. 
This evidence that topography of incoming TCAs relies on cues in the corridor region spurred a series of studies aimed at delineating the cues present along the thalamocortical pathway in the subpallium. 

Gradient expression of Slit1 by corridor cells contributes to the organization of intermediate and rostral TCAs in the subpallium \cite{bielle2011emergent}. 
In addition to Slit1-expressing corridor cells, there are several gradients of guidance cues across the rostral-caudal axis of the striatum at the time of TCA extension through the region. 
Subsets of thalamic projection neurons express specific combinations of guidance receptors and CAMs that correspondingly interact with gradients of guidance cues in the subpallium, leading to topographic organization of TCAs (reviewed in \cite{garel2014inputs,molnar2012mechanisms}). 
Differential expression of EphA3, 4, and 7 on TCAs mediates their interaction with a rostral-low to caudal-high ephrin-A5 gradient in the corridor and subpallium \cite{dufour2003area}; TCAs expressing EphB1 and B2 receptors are repelled from the ventrolateral telencephalon by ephrin-B1 \cite{robichaux2014ephb}; responsiveness to the high-rostral low-caudal netrin-1 gradient in the developing striatum is mediated by differential TCA expression of DCC and Unc5 \cite{powell2008topography}, Robo1, and its coreceptor FLRT3 \cite{leyva2014flrt3}; Neurogenin2 guides TCA responsiveness to subpallium cues \cite{seibt2003neurogenin2}; and NrCAM mediates responsiveness to Sema3F in the subpallium \cite{demyanenko2011nrcam}. 

The CTA waiting period in the subpallium, a necessary step in the “handshake” with TCAs, required for mutual guidance, is regulated by transient expression of PlexinD1 on pioneer CTAs. 
PlexinD1 binds to Sema3E on radial glia near the PSPB in the intermediate target region of the pathway, mediating a growth-inhibition response \cite{deck2013pathfinding}. 
This waiting period is essential for the correct projection of CTAs because it temporally positions them to engage in necessary interactions with reciprocal TCAs (discussed in more detail below). 
A waiting period has also been described for TCAs, which cluster and pause below the cortical plate before entering the cortex and navigating to the appropriate cortical regions \cite{ghosh1992pathfinding,leyva2013and,lund1977development}. 
The mechanisms and rationale for the TCA waiting period below the cortex remain unclear, but recent evidence suggests that ascending TCAs require descending CTAs in order to cross the PSPB and innervate the cortex \cite{chen2012evidence}.
