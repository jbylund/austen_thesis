Using genetic labeling and classic dye tracing approaches, I demonstrated that the ipsilateral RGC projection is segregated throughout the retinogeniculate pathway, and that the eye-specific and topographic maps of RGC axon in the optic tract are largely in alignment.
These experiments provide the most comprehensive view of axon organization in the retinogeniculate pathway to date.

I will discuss the technical limitations of these experiments, which while minor, should be taken into account when interpreting the results presented in this chapter.
Subsequently, I will summarize first the eye-specific and then the topographic findings and situate them in the context of the existing literature on the axon organization in the retinogeniculate pathway.
