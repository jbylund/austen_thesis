Given the identification of ipsilateral RGC-specific markers, one of the best ways, in theory, to trace ipsi axons in the mouse retinogeniculate pathway would be using a genetic reporter line.
Because the transcription factor Zic2 regulates the ipsilateral RGC projection \cite{herrera2003zic2,williams2003ephrin}, a Zic2 reporter mouse would be ideal to genetically trace the ipsi RGC axon cohort.
A BAC-transgenic Zic2 reporter mouse exists (Tg(Zic2-EGFP)HT146Gsat), but analysis of this mouse by a former lab member indicated that the green fluorescent protein (GFP) signal was not faithful to endogenous \emph{Zic2} expression {Wang, 2013}, rendering it unreliable for labeling the ipsi RGC population and its axonal projections.

However, Zic2 directly regulates expression of the serotonin transporter (SERT) (Figure~\ref{Figures/Sert_Retina}A) \cite{garcia2010zic2}.
SERT is important for eye-specific segregation in the dLGN and SC, but is not involved in the midline choice of ipsi RGC axons at the optic chiasm \cite{salichon2001excessive,upton1999excess,garcia2010zic2}.
A report using the ET33 SERT-Cre line from GENSAT to study eye-specific axon refinement in the dLGN confirmed the specific expression of Cre in ipsi RGC axon terminals in the dLGN \cite{koch2011pathway}.
We therefore acquired ET33 SERT-Cre:zsgreen mice to follow ipsi RGC axons through the optic nerve, chiasm, and tract.
This is a useful tool not only because of the reliability and specifity afforded by genetics, but because it provides the clearest view of ipsilateral axon organization in the optic nerve.
Anterograde labeling cannot distinguish ipsi and contra axons in the nerve, prior to their sorting at the midline optic chiasm; and back-labeling experiments, which have been conducted \cite{colello1990early}, often do not label the entire ipsilateral cohort.
This section will present my analysis of ipsi RGC axon organization in the retinogeniculate pathway utilizing zsgreen expression in SERT-Cre:zsgreen mice.

SERT-Cre::zsgreen mice have robust zsgreen expression restricted to the ventrotemporal (VT) retina, the source of ipsi RGCs (Figure~\ref{Figures/Sert_Retina}B).
This is consistent with the SERT-Cre expression pattern shown by Koch et al. (2011) and SERT mRNA expression shown by Garc\'ia-Frigola \& Herrera (2010), which corresponds to Zic2 mRNA expression. 
The expression of zsgreen, seen in a frontal section of the retina, is restricted to the RGC layer, and the RGC axons can be traced as they exit the retina and enter the ventral portion of the optic nerve (Figure~\ref{Figures/Sert_NerveToTract}A).
Once in the optic nerve, zsgreen+ axons cluster predominantly in a ventral-lateral position, although there is a secondary cluster of zsgreen+ axons in the medial optic nerve (Figure~\ref{Figures/Sert_NerveToTract}B\textsuperscript{1}).
This second cluster of zsgreen+ axons appears more loosely bundled than the larger set of zsgreen+ axons in the ventral-lateral nerve.
As the optic nerve nears the optic chiasm, labeled axons appear progressively less well ordered and less tightly bundled together (Figure~\ref{Figures/Sert_NerveToTract}B\textsuperscript{2-4}).
This observation is in line with previous reports based on retrograde labeling from the optic tract \cite{colello1990early}.

Within the optic chiasm, zsgreen+ axons still interacting with repulsive midline cues do so across nearly the full dorsal-ventral extent of the chiasm (vertical lines in Figure~\ref{Figures/Sert_NerveToTract}C).
The images shown in Figure~\ref{Figures/Sert_NerveToTract} are from a P0 mouse.
The majority of ipsi RGC axons have turned away from and extended beyond the optic chiasm at this age, hence the predominant zsgreen signal appearing at either side of the midline.
However, the axons from the latest-born ipsi RGCs are still navigating the chiasm at P0, and these are likely the zsgreen+ axons seen more sparsely in the middle of the micrographs in Figure~\ref{Figures/Sert_NerveToTract}C.

After navigating the midline cues and turning away from the optic chiasm, ipsi RGC axons enter the optic tract (Figure~\ref{Figures/Sert_NerveToTract}D).
In a progression reciprocal to that seen in Figure~\ref{Figures/Sert_NerveToTract}B\textsuperscript{1-4}, zsgreen+ axons are loosely bundled just caudal to the chiasm (Figure~\ref{Figures/Sert_NerveToTract}D\textsuperscript{1}) and become increasingly well bundled the further into the tract they extend (Figure~\ref{Figures/Sert_NerveToTract}D\textsuperscript{2-3}).
As the optic tract continues to extend to the first thalamic target, the dLGN, zsgreen+ RGC axons remain clustered to the lateral edge of the optic tract (Figure~\ref{Figures/Sert_dLGN}).
The clustering of zsgreen+ axons to the lateral edge of the optic tract does not appear to change along the length of the tract, even as axons approach the dLGN.
%Given that the more caudal of the two sections shown in Figure~\ref{Figures/Sert_dLGN} (B) contains more zsgreen+ axons than its neighboring prior section (A), it is possible that this cohort of axons are biased to the caudal optic tract.
