Using both genetic labeling and classic dye tracing approaches, I have demonstrated that the ipsilateral RGC projection is segregated throughout much of the retinogeniculate pathway, and that the eye-specific and topographic maps of RGC axon in the optic tract are largely in alignment.
While each approach has its own minor technical limitations, which I will discuss in more detail later, these experiments provide the most comprehensive view of axon organization in the retinogeniculate pathway to date.
This section will summarize my findings and situate them in the context of the existing literature on the axon organization in the retinogeniculate pathway.
