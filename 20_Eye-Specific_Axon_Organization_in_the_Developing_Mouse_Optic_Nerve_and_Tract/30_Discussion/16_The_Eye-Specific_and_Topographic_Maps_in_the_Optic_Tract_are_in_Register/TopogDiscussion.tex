I undertook a reassessment of the topographic organization of axons in the optic tract to clarify the relationship between the topographic and typographic (eye-specific) maps in the mouse optic tract.
It was challenging to make this comparison between my data on eye-specific axon organization and the existing reports on topographic axon organization because the literature describing such order in the tract was inconsistent in its approaches and conclusions.

Summarize findings, which provide more clarity than the previous literature

Postulate mechanisms for topographic versus typographic order

Furthermore, Reh et al. hypothesize the presence of attractive cues along the dorsal neuraxis that could preferentially act upon ventral RGC axons, providing a tract-specific mechanism of active axon organization that would occur independently of target derived cues \cite{reh1983organization}.
