Furthermore, Reh et al. hypothesize the presence of attractive cues along the dorsal neuraxis that could preferentially act upon ventral RGC axons, providing a tract-specific mechanism of active axon organization that would occur independently of target derived cues \cite{reh1983organization}.


The earliest-born RGCs in the mouse extend axons from the dorsocentral retina and project either ipsi- or contralaterally.
Even though the early ipsilateral RGCs arising from this region are transient, their axons segregate in the optic tract from those of their contralaterally-projecting counterparts, underscoring the presence of eye-specific order in the tract \cite{soares2015transient}.

SERT might be in some contras
