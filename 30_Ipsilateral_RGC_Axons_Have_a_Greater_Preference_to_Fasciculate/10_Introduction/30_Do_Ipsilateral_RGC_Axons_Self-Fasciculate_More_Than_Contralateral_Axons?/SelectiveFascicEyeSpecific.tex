These studies represent some of the relatively recent progress made in understanding selective fasciculation within axon tracts.
Noticeably, a large fraction of that work has focused on the role of fasciculation in maintaining heterotypic axon cohorts in reciprocal projections (i.e., the sensory and motor axons in the peripheral nerves).
However, far less is known 

\cite{weth2014chemoaffinity} for proposition of axon-axon as well axon-target interactions being important in map formation
I want to extend this idea further, looking at axon-axon interactions prior to the target

Introducing my work - discuss dearth of reliable quantitative methods, especially for looking at subtle differences
\cite{jaworski2012autocrine} as bundle width example, but point out that it's looking at very large differences and also that methods section is fucking useless
