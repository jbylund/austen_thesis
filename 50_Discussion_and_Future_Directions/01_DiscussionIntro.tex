The preceding three chapters presented my dissertation research studying RGC axon organization in the developing mouse retinogeniculate pathway.
In this concluding chapter, I will first review my findings and discuss them more broadly in the context of both the existing literature and future directions to take.
I will also explore other possible cellular and molecular mechanisms that may mediate the pre-target organization of RGC axons, and how future studies might explore such mechanisms.
Finally, I will address the importance of studying pre-target axon organization and why studying more subtle aspects of circuit formation will be an important area for the field to focus on moving forward.
