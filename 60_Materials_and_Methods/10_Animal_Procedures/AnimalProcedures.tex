Mice were housed in a barrier facility at Columbia University Medical Center and maintained in a timed-pregnancy colony under the supervision of the lab mouse technician, Hranush Melikyan.
All animal procedures were carried out in accordance with protocols (current protocol numbers AC-AAAQ5424 and AC-AAAQ5425) approved by Columbia University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. 
Breeding females were checked for vaginal plug at noon each weekday.
The day a vaginal plug was detected was considered E0.5.
Embryos were harvested as close to noon on the day of collection as possible.
Wild-type animals were C57BL/6J.
SERT-Cre:zsgreen mice were maintained on a C57BL/6J background.
The SERT-Cre:zsgreen mice were a gift from Drs. Weisheng Chen and Tom Maniatis and originally contained a mutant allele for Protocadherin, which was bred to wild-type before use in my experiments.
EphB1\textsuperscript{-/-} mice were maintained on a 129S1/SvImJ background.
SERT-Cre:zsgreen;EphB1 mice were bred for three generations before collecting litters, and all experiments compared littermates with SERT-Cre:zsgreen\textsuperscript{+/-} and either EphB1\textsuperscript{-/-}, \textsuperscript{+/+}, or \textsuperscript{+/-}.
