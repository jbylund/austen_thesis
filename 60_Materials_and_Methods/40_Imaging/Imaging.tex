Most of the imaging presented in this thesis was performed using a Zeiss AxioImager M2 microscope with Apotome, AxioCam MRm camera, Neurolucida software (v11, MBF Biosciences, Williston, VT, USA); with a 5X objective lens (FLUAR, NA=0.25, working distance=12.5mm), a 20X objective lens (PLAN-APOCHROMAT, NA=0.8, working distance=550$\mu$m), or 40X objective lens (Plan-APO, NA=1.4, working distance=130$\mu$m).
Using the principle of structured illumination, the Apotome provides confocal-like resolution with epifluorescence imaging.
The Apotome improves the signal to noise ratio by acquiring three images of an optical section and subtracting background fluorescence signal.
Images were acquired in MBF raw format and processed in Fiji (ImageJ, NIH).

Confocal imaging was performed at the Confocal and Specialized Microscopy Shared Resource (CSMSR) of the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center at Columbia University, supported by NIH grant $#$P30 CA013696 (National Cancer Institute), under supervision of Drs. T. Swayne and L. Pon.
The images in Figure~\ref{Figures/DiIDiDWholeTract} were acquired using Nikon Ti Eclipse inverted A1 confocal microscope with Plan-Fluor 40X Oil objective (NA=1.3) and Nikon NIS Elements software.
The images in Figure~\ref{Figures/HighResIpsiContra} were acquired using a Nikon Ti Eclipse inverted A1RMP multiphoton confocal microscope with Plan-Fluor 40X Oil objective (NA=1.3) and Nikon NIS Elements software.
Images were processed in Fiji.
