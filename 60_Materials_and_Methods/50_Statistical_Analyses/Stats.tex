Statistical analyses for the \emph{en face} assay of fasciculation and zsgreen\textsuperscript{+} cells in the retina and axons in the optic tract of SERT-Cre:zsgreen;EphB1 mice were performed in GraphPad Prism 7, using the Kruskal-Wallis test.
Analysis of fasciculation frequency in the \emph{en face} assay was performed in Microsoft Excel using a student's t-test.
P values greater than 0.05 were considered statistically insignificant.
Graphing and statistical analysis for the bundle width assay of fasciculation were performed with python using code written by Dr.~J.~Bylund.
The scipy.stats package was used to run the Mann-Whitney U test to compare cumulative distribution functions between explant types and conditions.
The matplotlib.pyplot package was used to plot cumulative distribution functions.
