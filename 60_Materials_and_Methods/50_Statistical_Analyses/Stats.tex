Statistical analyses and graphing for the \emph{en face} assay of fasciculation were performed in Microsoft Excel (for Mac, 2011).
Statistical significance of fasciculation frequency and axon bundling index were determined using 1-tailed student's t-test.
A p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Analysis of SERT-Cre:zsgreen expression in SERT-Cre:zsgreen;EphB1 mice was performed in Microsoft Excel using a 2-tailed student's t-test.
P values greater than 0.05 were considered statistically insignificant.
Graphing and statistical analysis for the bundle width assay of fasciculation were performed with python using code written by Dr.~J.~Bylund.
The scipy.stats package was used to run the Mann-Whitney U test to compare cumulative distribution functions between explant types and conditions.
The matplotlib.pyplot package was used to plot cumulative distribution functions.
