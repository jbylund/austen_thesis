I contributed to a collaboration with Dr. Paolo Panza and Dr. Christian S\"ollner in 2014 studying the role of \emph{Linx} in the developing of the murine binocular circuit.
Dr. Panza had found a striking ipsilateral induction phenotype in zebrafish \emph{Islr2} mutants (the gene name of \emph{Linx} in zebrafish).
He asked us to investigate the loss of function mutant in the mouse.
These findings were published in a manuscript in 2015 \cite{panza2015lrr}, which also explored the role of binding partners to Islr2 in the glial knot at the optic chiasm of zebrafish.
I have reproduced relevant parts of the manuscript here.
