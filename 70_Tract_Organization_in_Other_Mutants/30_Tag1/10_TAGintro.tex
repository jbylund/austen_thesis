TAG-1 (also known as contactin-2 and, in chick, axonin-1) is a member of the Ig/fibronectin type-III CAM family, which has been implicated in axon guidance and fasciculation \cite{dodd1988spatial,stoeckli1995axonin}.
It can bind homophilically \cite{kunz2002axonin}, and can also bind heterophilically to other molecules, including L1 \cite{kunz1998neurite} to mediate cell-cell adhesion and neurite fasciculation.
Of particular interest is the expression of TAG-1 in the retinofugal pathway (e.g., \citenoparens{rager1996expression,williams2006role,chatzopoulou2008structural}).
\citetext{chatzopoulou2008structural} showed a slight expansion of the contra RGC projection in TAG-1\textsuperscript{-/-}, defasciculation in the optic nerve, and several defects axon-glia interactions, especially myelination and axon caliber in the nerve.
Furthermore, they demonstrated TAG-1/L1 mediated fasciculation of retinal axons \invitro{}.
