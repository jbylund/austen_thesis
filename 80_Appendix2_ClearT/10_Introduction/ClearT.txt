In 2012, I assisted Dr. Takaaki Kuwajima, a former postdoctoral fellow in the Mason Lab, as he developed a new tissue clearing method.
At the time, the Sca{\it l}e method had recently been published \cite{hama2011scale} and we found ourselves on the early wave of the tissue clearing trend.
Our motivation, in part, was the fact that many of the existing clearing methods at the time were incompatible with lipophilic dye tracers, which are standard fare not only in our lab but across the neurodevelopmental field.
As such, Dr. Kuwajima set out testing various chemical combinations based on his observation that the hybridization step in the \emph{in situ} hybridization protocol caused thin cryosections to become transparent.
Formamide, one of the ingredients in the hybridization buffer, became the centerpiece of {\it Clear^{T}} and {\it Clear^{T2}}.

One of the other hallmarks of clearing method publications has been the simultaneous development of new long-working-distance objectives and other advanced microscopy methods.
While such advances are exciting and many labs are putting such microscopy techniques to use, there are many labs with more limited access to more cutting edge microscopes.
Keeping this in mind, one of our goals with our publication was to use epifluorescent microscopy and demonstrate the efficacy of our clearing methods using more standard imaging.
I led the imaging efforts for the project, including guiding our approach to tailoring the clearing method and imaging approaches, and performing the majority of the imaging.
The rest of this chapter is a reproduction of our 2013 publication \cite{kuwajima2013cleart} with a few additional notes and details added.
