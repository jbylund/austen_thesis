Noon of the day on which a plug was found was considered to be E0.5.
C57BL/6J wild-type and \emph{actin}-GFP mouse embryos were removed from mothers anesthetized with ketamine-xylazine (100 and 10 mg/kg, respectively, in 0.9\% saline); postnatal wild-type, \emph{Thy1}-GFP (M-line) (gift from J. A. Gogos, Columbia University, NY, USA) and adult \emph{Tcf/Lef:H2B}-GFP mice (gift from E. Laufer, Columbia University, NY, USA) were anesthetized with ketamine-xylazine (100 and 10 mg/kg, respectively, in 0.9\% saline), fixed in 4\% paraformaldehyde (PFA)/PBS (pH 7.4) overnight, or perfused and washed with PBS at 4Â°C.
Embryos were perfused transcardially for optimal clearing.
All clearing protocols took place at room temperature.
