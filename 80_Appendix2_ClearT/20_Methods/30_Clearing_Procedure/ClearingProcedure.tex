Incubation times in each solution vary according to tissue thickness for the desired transparency (see Table~\ref{} for details).

Sca\emph{l}eA2 has been described previously \cite{hama2011scale}.
E14.5 embryos were cleared with Sca\emph{l}eA2 for 14 days; DiI-labeled embryos or CTB-labeled sections were treated overnight or 2 hours, respectively.

BABB has been described \cite{dodt2007ultramicroscopy}.
DiI-labeled embryos or CTB-labeled sections were treated with BABB overnight or for 2 hours, respectively, after dehydration with 30\%, 50\%, 70\%, and 100\% ethanol for 1 hour each and with hexane for 1 hour.
