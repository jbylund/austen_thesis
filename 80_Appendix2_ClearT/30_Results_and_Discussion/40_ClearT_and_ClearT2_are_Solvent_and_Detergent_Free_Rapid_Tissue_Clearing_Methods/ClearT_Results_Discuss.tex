We have developed two clearing methods, \emph{Clear\textsuperscript{T}} and \emph{Clear\textsuperscript{T2}}, which aid analysis of fluorescent labeling in embryonic and mature neuronal and non-neuronal tissue.
\emph{Clear\textsuperscript{T2}} clears specimens while effectively maintaining the fluorescent signal of genetically encoded proteins, immunohistochemistry labeling, and dye tracers such as DiI and CTB.
Whereas \emph{Clear\textsuperscript{T}} is incompatible with immunohistochemistry and genetically encoded fluorescence proteins (supplementary material Table S1), transparency of whole brains treated with \emph{Clear\textsuperscript{T}} is better than with \emph{Clear\textsuperscript{T2}} (Figure~\ref{ClearT_Fig3}A).
Therefore, tissue samples labeled with DiI or CTB alone are best cleared by \emph{Clear\textsuperscript{T}}.

\emph{Clear\textsuperscript{T}} and \emph{Clear\textsuperscript{T2}} provide several advantages over other available clearing methods.
Clearing time for thick sections, whole brains or embryos is significantly faster than with Sca\emph{l}eA2 or BABB.
In addition, \emph{Clear\textsuperscript{T}} and \emph{Clear\textsuperscript{T2}} produce minimal tissue volume changes, significantly less than Sca\emph{l}eA2 or BABB.
Most importantly, our methods maintain DiI- and CTB-labeling in axons, unlike Sca\emph{l}eA2 and BABB (Table~\ref{ClearT_Suppl.tgn}).
\emph{Clear\textsuperscript{T}} and \emph{Clear\textsuperscript{T2}} successfully clear postnatal and adult brain and other tissues.
\emph{Clear\textsuperscript{T2}} provides a final important advantage over Sca\emph{l}eA2 and BABB, in that it can clear immunolabeled tissue.
Thus, \emph{Clear\textsuperscript{T}} and \emph{Clear\textsuperscript{T2}} provide improved clearing of embryonic and adult neuronal and non-neuronal tissue for viewing fluorescent labeling of cells and fiber tracts by high-resolution optical imaging.

		\emph{Clear\textsuperscript{T}} and \emph{Clear\textsuperscript{T2}} were composed of 95\% formamide or 50\% formamide plus 20\% PEG, respectively, and clear tissue more rapidly than Sca\emph{l}eA2 and BABB while also producing less volume change.
		Transparency in \emph{Clear\textsuperscript{T}} and \emph{Clear\textsuperscript{T2}} was better than in Sca\emph{l}eA2 or BABB.
		Transparency of whole embryos with \emph{Clear\textsuperscript{T2}} was not as extensive as with \emph{Clear\textsuperscript{T}}.
		\emph{Clear\textsuperscript{T}} and \emph{Clear\textsuperscript{T2}} are compatible with DiI and CTB labeling.
		\emph{Clear\textsuperscript{T2}} is also compatible with visualization of fluorescent proteins and immunolabeled tissues.
		Tissue clearing with \emph{Clear\textsuperscript{T}} or \emph{Clear\textsuperscript{T2}} can be carried out in plastic chambers.}
