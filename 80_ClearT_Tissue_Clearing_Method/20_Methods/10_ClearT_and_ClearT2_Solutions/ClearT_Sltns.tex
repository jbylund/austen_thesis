For \emph{Clear\textsuperscript{T}}, 20\%, 40\%, 80\% and 95\% formamide solutions were made by adding formamide (99.6\%, considered 100\%) (Fisher) to PBS (pH 7.4) (vol/vol).
For \emph{Clear\textsuperscript{T2}}, a 50\% formamide/20\% polyethylene glycol (PEG) solution was made by mixing formamide (99.6\%, considered 100\%, as made for \emph{Clear\textsuperscript{T}}) with 40\% PEG/H\textsubscript{2}O (wt/vol) at a ratio of 1:1 (vol/vol).
A 25\% formamide/10\% PEG solution was made by mixing 50\% formamide plus 20\% PEG/H\textsubscript{2}O (wt/vol) at a ratio of 1:1 (vol/vol).
A 40\% PEG solution was made by stirring powdered PEG 8000 MW (Sigma-Aldrich) in warm H\textsubscript{2}O for 30 minutes, and is stable at room temperature for several months.
