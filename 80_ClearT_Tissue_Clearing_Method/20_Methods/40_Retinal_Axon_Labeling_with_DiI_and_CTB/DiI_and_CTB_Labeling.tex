Anterograde DiI labeling has been described previously \cite{plump2002slit1}.
The eye was placed back into the optic cup and heads were incubated in PBS containing 0.1\% sodium azide as follows: E14-E16, 5-7 days at

The retinogeniculate projection was labeled with CTB as described previously \cite{jaubert2005structural,rebsam2009switching}, and single neuron labeling in the CTB-labeled dLGN was performed as described previously \cite{krahe2011morphologically}.
