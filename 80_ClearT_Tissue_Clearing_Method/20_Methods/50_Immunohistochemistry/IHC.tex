Vibratome and cryosections were blocked in 5\% BSA/1\% Tween (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS (pH 7.4) for 1 hour at room temperature.
Mouse monoclonal anti-RC2 (IgM) antibody (Developmental Hybridoma Bank) (1:4) and mouse monoclonal anti-neurofilament (IgG) antibody (2H3) (a gift from T. Jessell and S. Morton, Columbia University, NY, USA) (1:5) were incubated in 1\% BSA/1\% Tween in PBS overnight at 4\textcelsius.
After washes with 1\% Tween in PBS, Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse IgM and Cy5-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:500) secondary antibodies (Jackson) were applied, incubated in 1\% BSA/1\% Tween in PBS overnight at 4\textcelsius.
Hoechst 33258 (Molecular Probes) was used for nuclear staining.
Wholemount immunolabeling of embryos with anti-neurofilament antibody has been described previously \cite{huber2005distinct}.
