Proposed Outline for Thesis
1. Introduction
	i. Introduce and situate the problem in context: how is specificity in neural circuitry established?
	ii. Basics of axon guidance/chemoaffinity
	iii. Evidence from other systems that tract organization is an important component of circuit development, in addition to other studied aspects (target-derived cues, intermediate target)
	iv. Basics of visual system development in the mouse
	v. Pose the question: Is there pre-target sorting of binocular RGC axons in the mouse OT?
	vi. Review literature of visual system axon order (topographic, age-specific, etc.)
	vii. Outline project

2. The eye-specific organization of RGC axons in the developing mouse optic tract
	i. Whole-eye tract labeling experiments at different ages
	ii. Eye-specific organization is distinct from topographic organization in the tract (VT/VT)
	iii. Ipsi axons are segregated in the nerve
	iv. Description of glia in relation to ipsi and contra axon cohorts?
	v. EM of the tract?

3. Fasciculation Behavior of ipsi and contra axons
	i. Higher resolution images of ipsi and contra fibers from tract labeling experiments
	ii. In vitro approach: describe
	iii. VT neurites have a greater tendency to self-fasciculate in vitro and do so for longer distances than contras
	iv. Data from culture experiments with chiasm cells
	v. A note on the potential for this assay to be used to test other candidate molecules (from Qingâ€™s microarray) (here or appendix)

4. A role for EphB1 in tract organization and fasciculation
	i. There is aberrant fasciculation of the remaining ipsi fibers in the tract of EphB1-/- mice (in vivo tract labeling data)
	ii. Data and analysis of in vitro EphB1/wt and EphB1/EphB1 co-culture experiments: a role for EphB1 in fasciculation behavior of ipsi neurites?
