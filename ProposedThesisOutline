Organization of retinal ganglion cell axons in the developing mouse retinogeniculate pathway

1. Introduction
	i. History of axon guidance, set up the question: how is specificity in neural circuitry established?
	ii. Basics of axon guidance/chemoaffinity
	iii. Pre-target axon organization in tracts of various systems (Evidence from other systems that tract organization is an important component of circuit development, in addition to other studied aspects (target-derived cues, intermediate target))
	iv. Basics of visual system development in the mouse
	v. Pose the question: Is there pre-target sorting of binocular RGC axons in the mouse OT?
	vi. Outline project

2. Ipsilateral and contralateral RGC axons are segregated in the developing mouse retinogeniculate pathway
	i. Introduction
		- Review literature of visual system axon order (topographic, age-specific, Godement paper for ipsi/contra)
	ii. Ipsi axons are organized in the optic nerve and tract
	iii. Ipsi and contra axons are segregated from each other in the tract
	iv. Eye-specific axon organization is shifted slightly from the topographic map in the optic tract
	v. Discussion 

3. Fasciculation Behavior of ipsi and contra axons
	i. Introduction
		- Fasciculation typically only considered in pioneer/follower axon paradigm
		- Anecdotes in lab of greater ipsi fasciculation
	ii. Higher resolution images of ipsi and contra fibers from tract labeling experiments
	ii. In vitro approach: describe
	iii. VT neurites have a greater intrinsic tendency to self-fasciculate in vitro 
	iv. Extrinsic cues from dissociated chiasm cells shifts both VT and DT neurites to form thicker bundles, but does not eliminate the intrinsic preference of VT neurites to self-associate
	v. Discussion
		- A note on the potential for this assay to be used to test other candidate molecules

4. A role for EphB1 in tract organization and fasciculation
	i. Introduction
		- EphB1 as a model to link midline choice, tract order, and targeting
	ii. Aberrant fasciculation of the remaining ipsi fibers in the tract of EphB1-/- mice (in vivo tract labeling data) and some ipsi axons stray
	iii. A role for EphB1 in fasciculation behavior of ipsi neurites: EphB1 culture experiments show VT preference for fasciculation remains, but is reduced relative to WT
	iv. EphB1+Sert: aberrantly crossing EphB1-null axons still associate with the ipsilateral tract
	v. Discussion

5. Discussion and Conclusions
