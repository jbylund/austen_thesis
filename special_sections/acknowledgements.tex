I would like to thank my advisor, Carol Mason, for her support over the years.
She has provided guidance, shared her knowledge, and been a source of warm and enthusiastic encouragement throughout my time as a student, even before I joined her lab.
She has helped me nurture and develop my love of using detailed anatomical approaches and careful observations to understanding the brain.
It was this shared appreciation that first drew me to her lab, and I'm grateful for having been able to conduct research in this vein in an environment where it is celebrated and appreciated.
I have grown tremendously as a scientist in her lab, and I deeply appreciate the opportunities she has given me and helped me to cultivate on my own.

Carol also has a remarkable knack for filling her lab with deeply kind, good-natured people, and it has been a pleasure to work with such lovely labmates.
Rich, with whom I've sat back-to-back in our shared bay for several years now, has been a source of thoughtful conversation, lighthearted joking, mutual understanding, and, of course, trading cat stories.
It's been an absolute pleasure to share a lab bay with him, and I'm glad he waited to retire until I finished up.
Mika is one of the kindest souls I've met, and incredibly hard working.
I'm so appreciative of all her work in the lab, including all of the little things that make it a better place to work, like keeping the plants alive an frequently bringing in homemade baked goods --- she even learned some new (delicious) gluten free baking tricks on my behalf.

Alex trained me when I was just starting out in Carol's lab, and I learned a lot from her in a relatively short amount of time.
She continues to be a valuable source of input and guidance from afar.
Taka, one of the best scientists I've had the pleasure of working with, has also mentored me, and is a patient and enthusiastic teacher.
I will forever remember not only all the in vitro techniques he so expertly taught me, but also the many delightful life conversations and good humor.
I have also learned a great deal from the other postdocs in the lab, Florencia and Lena, and especially in the last couple of years I have appreciated how our friendships have grown.
The other students in the lab have also been a great source of friendship over the years.
Punita and Qing both took me under their wings and were and continue to be a great source of support even after they left the lab.
Celia was a delight to work with and I loved her zeal for experiencing the ``American life'' while she was here.
I'm grateful for Melissa coming to the lab more recently, and keeping me company and being such a good fellow cat-lady friend.
It's been a pleasure to be part of her training in the Mason Lab and I'm excited to see where her project and career take her.
Anna was a joy to work with during her time in the lab, and I also appreciate all the work and good company from the many undergraduate and high school students who have passed through the lab, particularly Sophie, Claire, Irene, Sania, and Rhenuma.
